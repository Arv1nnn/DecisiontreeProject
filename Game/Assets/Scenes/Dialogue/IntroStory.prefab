    - "It all started that day. The 12th of March, 2078. Some call it \u201CThe Miracle\u201D,
      while others call it \u201CThe Disaster\u201D. \r\n"
    - "Suddenly, every human on Earth became able to use magic. Some could grow plants
      quicker, some could light candles from a distance; Some could turn a town into
      a crater the size of Manhattan.\r"
    - 'The most powerful among them became eager to use their own powers. As a result,
      the biggest revolution in human history began. It was complete anarchy. '

    - "All the countries in the world tried to stop it. Air raids were called, giant
      battlefields were erected, and many lives were lost. After the entirety of
      France was taken over, the first nuke was launched. Then came another. And
      another.\r\nBut it didn\u2019t matter.\r"
    - 'The "Law of the Jungle" is still very much in effect, but instead of allowing
      just anyone to go and remove the leader of a country, regular "Arena" battles
      are held. '
    - Anyone can enter the Arena, and the final victor is deemed the "strongest",
      and thus is granted the right to lead everyone else in power.
